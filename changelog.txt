    Created this website.
    Did most of the layout.

26
    Fixed everything except the masonry items.
    Added the search bar and filter/sort buttons, but have not implemented the js yet.
    Cleaned up the css files.

27, 28
    Stupid JQuery, I don't know how to use this garbanzo.
    Eventually got the Isotope plugin working with the grid.

2023-03-01
    Added meta data.
    Small tweaks to css and html.








Things to Add/Fix:
    Change some of the filter buttons to dropdowns and toggles.
    Implement JS for adding new items to the masonry.
    Will remove jQuery and only use vanilla JS
    A bit of inconsistance in naming, camelCase and kebab-case
    JS is a bit repeatative (i don't know how to use Isotope or JQuery properly, so I don't know how to fix it)
